suite: Pod Disruption Budget tests
templates:

tests:
# NOTE: It is difficult to reason about the percentage (string) values. It requires the developers to know how the rounding logic works for PDBs.
#       Supporting both integer values and string values also requires more complex logic in the helm chart, which makes it more difficult to maintain.
- it: "Should not allow percentage value as maxUnavailablePods"
  set: 
    podDisruptionBudget.enable: true
    podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailablePods: 50%

  set:

# NOTE: This case would block a node from being drained indefinitely
- it: "Should not allow 0 as maxUnavailablePods"
  set: 
    podDisruptionBudget.enable: true
    podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailablePods: 0
  asserts:
  - failedTemplate: {}

# NOTE: maxUnavailable has been chosen since it easier to reason about without having to account for pod replica count. 
#       It is also recommended to use maxUnavailable in the official k8s documentation.
#       We do not support minAvailable for now, but might add support in the future if a use-case presents itself.
#       Supporting both minAvailable and maxUnavailable will introduce more complexity in the helm chart and might prove more difficult to maintain.
- it: "Should render maxUnavailable on PDB manifest when setting maxUnavailablePods"
